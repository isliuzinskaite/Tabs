      <h2>The Daimler Reitwagen</h2>
      The Daimler Reitwagen is widely considered as the world’s first true motorcycle. Gottlieb Daimler is often referred to as “the father of the motorcycle” because of this invention and it was his son, Paul, who rode it for the first time in November 1885.<br>

      <h2>Harley-Davidson XR750</h2>
      The Harley-Davidson XR-750 is a racing motorcycle made by Harley-Davidson since 1970, primarily for dirt track racing, but also for road racing in the XRTT variant. The XR-750 went on to win the most races in the history of American Motorcyclist Association (AMA) racing.<br>
      Evel Knievel used the bike from December 1970 until his final jump in January 1977. An XR-750 was included in the 1998 The Art of the Motorcycle exhibition, and one of Knievel's bikes is in the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History America on the Move exhibit. <br>

      <h2>Aprilia Tuono V4 Factory</h2>
      Few streetfighter-style bikes get the blood boiling like a V4 Tuono. And in Factory colours it’s hard to look away — my heart comes into my throat. <br>
      Of course, the Aprilia Tuono V4 Factory isn’t just one of the best-looking motorcycles. It’s one of the best motorcycles! <br>
      Like other streetfighters, the Tuono V4 aims to be an “everyday superbike”. This isn’t a naked bike or a sport standard — it’s its own thing. You might note, for example, that it still has a fairing that’s attached to the frame.<br>
